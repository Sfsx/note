+ 前端使用固定 salt 加密后送给后端
+ 后端生成强大的 salt 将前端送来的值加密储存
+ 使用安全的 hash 函数
+ 如果可能，使用 HTTPS
+ npm delegates 用于管理伪属性类型
+ 有时需要允许访问返回动态计算值的属性，或者你可能需要反映内部变量的状态，而不需要使用显式方法调用。在JavaScript中，可以使用 getter 来实现。虽然可以使用 getter 和 setter 来创建一个伪属性类型，但是不可能同时将一个 getter 绑定到一个属性并且该属性实际上具有一个值。

    What is the difference between using `<Link to="/page">` and `<a href="page">`
    On the surface, you seem to be comparing apples and oranges here. The path in your anchor tag is a relative path while that one in the Link is absolute (rightly so, I don't think react-router supports relative paths yet). The problem this creates is say you are on `/blah`, while clicking on your Link will go to `/page`, clicking on the `<a href='page' />` will take you to `/blah/page`. This may not be an issue though since you confirmed the correctness of the url, but thought to note.
    A bit deeper difference, which is just an addon to @Dennis answer (and the docs he pointed to), is when you are already in a route that matches what the Link points to. Say we are currently on `/page` and the Link points to `/page` or even `/page/:id`, this won't trigger a full page refresh while an `<a />` tag naturally will. See issue on Github.
